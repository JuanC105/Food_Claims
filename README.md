# Vivendo Fast Food Chain Legal Claims Analysis

Hello there! I'm excited to share the journey of my Vivendo Fast Food Chain Legal Claims Analysis project with you. In this solo endeavor, I've delved deep into the data surrounding customer compensation claims due to food poisoning at Vivendo, a prominent fast food chain with a strong presence in Brazil, boasting over 200 outlets scattered across the nation.

## Background
As I embarked on this project, Vivendo was grappling with a recurring issue: a rising number of customer compensation claims arising from food poisoning incidents. Taking on the challenge, I decided to focus on the legal team's pivotal role in handling and processing these claims. With offices in four different locations, their task was to expedite response times and refine the claims closure process, ultimately ensuring both customer satisfaction and upholding the brand's reputation.
